## What do I use?

A collection of tools that I use.

- Computer: MacBook Pro (2020, 13-inch)
- Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3
- Camera: Nikon F5, 50 mm f/1.4 AF-D
- Scope: HP 54600A digital oscilloscope

#### Contact tracing

First, download the SingPass app. It's fast, convenient, and promises not to spy
on you (hopefully!).

Then [configure your iPhone][safe-entry] to make SafeEntry a more pleasant experience on iOS. It
should save some taps and time futzing around with a camera in front of QR codes
at entrances and exits. Kudos to mrbrown for posting about this.

1. Go to the SingPass app to activate Siri Shortcuts for SafeEntry.
1. Go to Settings ➡️  Accessibility ➡️  Touch ➡️  Back Tap, and turn it on.
1. Assign Scan SafeEntry to Double Tap, and SafeEntry Check-out to Triple Tap.
1. You can now double-tap the back of your iPhone to activate SafeEntry and
   triple-tap to check out.

Note: the Back Tap feature only works for iPhone 8 and above.
