<h2 class="mainTitle">about me</h2>
I am a high school graduate in Singapore interested in the creation of energy
materials which facilitate electrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches to
energy conversion such as artificial photosynthesis.

I completed my pre-university education at Victoria Junior College, where I was
the vice-chairperson of the robotics-makers club.

Most recently, I did an internship with the Nanyang Technological University’s
[artificial photosynthesis lab][group] under the supervision of [Han Sen
Soo][hansen].

## writing and photography
I'm a [film photographer][photos] into portraiture and street photography. I like the look of film and taking pictures of my friends.

I used to be interested in journalistic writing back when I was in school.
