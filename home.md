## about me
I am a high school graduate in Singapore interested in the creation of energy materials which facilitate electrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches to energy conversion such as artificial photosynthesis.

I am also interested in the organic and medicinal chemistry behind developing drugs to overcome antimicrobial resistance.

I completed my pre-university education at Victoria Junior College, where I was the vice-chairperson of the robotics-makers club.

## research
I completed an internship with the Nanyang Technological Universityâ€™s [artificial photosynthesis lab][group] under the supervision of [Han Sen Soo][hansen].

My projects involved the synthesis, isolation and purification of ligand systems using a range of conventional wet chemistry and air-sensitive techniques, and using them in metalation reactions to produce organometallic complexes.
